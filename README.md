# viaproxy-termux-tool
Automates setup quickly (at the moment only with Gui) 

this does not replaces the original work; it is merely a tool to provide an automated setup for Android users, thus simplifying the installation process.

vp.sh serves to simplify the use of the cli


just do the commands below 

curl -o cli.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoffezimJs/viaproxy-termux-tool/main/cli.sh && chmod +x cli.sh && dos2unix cli.sh && ./cli.sh

cd viaproxy && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoffezimJs/viaproxy-termux-tool/main/vp.sh && dos2unix vp.sh ./vp.sh


if it doesn't work:
dos2unix cli.sh
